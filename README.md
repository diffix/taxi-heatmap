## Taxi data heatmap

This has been largely copied from a [branch](https://github.com/diffix/coronaVirus/tree/piotr-internal/mapboxgl-compare/contact-tracing-demo) in the repo for an earlier [COVID-19 encounter tracing heatmap](https://github.com/diffix/coronaVirus).

### Deployment

To build and deploy the heatmap, follow the steps in `buildMapBox.py` to produce the data, and serve the entire contents of the resulting `www/mapbox` via a file server.
